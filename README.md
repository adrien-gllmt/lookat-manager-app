# LookAt Shop Manager App

LookAt Shop Manager is a personal project built on [React](https://en.reactjs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/).
It also uses several packages as [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/v6.3.0/getting-started/overview) or [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/).

The mission statement is not available at the moment, but I may upload it on my personal website someday.

## Where are we now ?

The app still in a very early version, so you may experience weird things.

In the end, it is planned to only have the dashboard, search page and folder page working.  
As it's not a definitive statement, I may code all the pages listed in the left-sided menu.

### Features

This section will be kept up to date.

Available :
- Switch from dashboard to search page (and vice-versa) from the left menu or the dashboard tile
- Fetch all products from the API and DB onto the search page
- Search products by vendor

Next : 
- All search parameters
- All dashboard sections and tiles completed
- Access to product card

Planned :
- Responsive
- See who booked a product
- Access to client card
